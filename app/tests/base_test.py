Goal: set the environment for tests

The only things you need to know compared to plain SQLAlchemy are:

Flask-SQLAlchemy gives you access to the following things:
 - all the functions and classes from sqlalchemy and sqlalchemy.orm
 - a preconfigured scoped session called session
 - the metadata
 - the engine
 - a SQLAlchemy.create_all() and SQLAlchemy.drop_all() methods to create and
    drop tables according to the models
 - a Model baseclass that is a configured declarative base
 - The Model declarative base class behaves like a regular Python class but has
    a query attribute attached that can be used to query the model
 - You have to commit the session, but you don't have to remove it at the end
    of the request, Flask-SQLAlchemy does that for you.
